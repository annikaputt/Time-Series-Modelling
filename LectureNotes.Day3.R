# AR 1 model
# When you think you have AR1 data, you should look for three things
# 1. Do I see a stationary trend? (no change overall through time)
# 2. Take a look at the acf plot: Are the acf spikes going down?
# 3. Look at the pacf plot: Area the spikes at the beginning of the pacf significant?

# Simulate data with phi=0.5
ar.sim <- arima.sim(model=list(ar=c(0.5)),n=100)
# The phi value controls the degree of correlation between consecutive points
# If the phi value is quite high it might lead to an artifial trend due to the high correlation

# MA(q)
# The moving average model regards the current value of the time series as a 
# moving average (unevenly weighted)
# q is used to denote the order of the moving average model
# Here, the correlation you are looking for is in the random noise, rather than
# The points themselves, so we want the PACF plot to decline. The acf will be more random

# It is hard to interpret what is going on here and what process is dominating

# Fitting an ARMA model (stationary data!)
# The process is called the box-jenkins method
# 1. Identification: Determinethe structure (i.e., what are p and q?)
# This is hard, so we will automate it.
# Once we have found these terms we will fix them for the estimation
# 2. Estimation: Estimate the parameters of the ARMA model
# 3. Diagnostics: Determine the adequacy of the final model

# Let's generate some data and analyze with ARMA

# The acf and pacf plots also suggest that this is an AR, MA, or ARMA model,

# Lets fit a model assuming AR(1) based on our spike in the pacf at lag of 1
ringindex.model <- arima(ringindex, order=c(1,0,0)) # c(p,d,q)
# When d is 0, it's equivalent to an ARMA model
# D is the differencing parameter, which we don't have to worry about because we have stationary data

ringindex.best <- auto.arima(ringindex,seasonal=FALSE,allowdrift=FALSE)

# Lets check to see if we cleared up our residual patterns

# In the title, the 12 shows that you have a 12 step season

# ARIMA Modelling
# ARIMA models can handle seasonal and trends in data
# Now we have a non-stationary data set

# Now let's use an ARIMA model
# We will set p, q, and d
Depth.model <- arima(Depth,order=c(1,1,2)) # We have set the differencing to 1
# to remove the trend, but we haven't added a seasonal componenet. We 
# will do that later when we look at seasonal co2 data

# How do we choose p, d, and q

# Check the acf and pacf from the original model and the differenced model
Acf(Depth)

# It looks like one order of differencing was enough to make the data stationary
# Now we can use auto arima to find the best model, given that we already know what d should be due to the trend

Depth.model <- auto.arima(Depth,seasonal=FALSE,allowdrift=FALSE) 
# Drift is not the same as trend, so we still set that as false

# The auto.arima can do the differencing for us, but this way we can visually
# see that we have removed the non-stationarity and seasonality in the time series.

# The seasonal ARIMA model we will fit to the co2 series will have the 
# following components: 
# A nonseasonal component (composed of p, q, and d)
# A seasonal component (composed of p, q, and d)

# Although we can have auto.arima fit this model for us, it may be better
# to use this manual method because we know what is happening here.
# auto.arima could be used to guide us if need be.
